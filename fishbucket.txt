clean your existing data from any of your index before going for re-indexing process, using the commands below.

 i)  # cd $SPLUNK_HOME/bin 
ii) # ./splunk stop 
iii) # ./splunk clean eventdata -index  <index-name>
( to clean All Indexes, just drop off -index <index-name> )
iv) # ./splunk start

remove/delete the fishbucket sub-directory which should re-index  all your data in all of your indexes.
CAUTION : Deleting the fishbucket sub-directory will re-index data coming into all your indexes from that splunk forwarder/instance, thus may severely impact your license usage.

To delete/remove the fishbucket:

1. Move to the directory   /opt/splunk/var/lib/splunk  (on the instance forwarding data)

2. Delete/Remove the sub-directory fishbucket 

deleting/removing the fish bucket

i)  #cd $SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk 
ii) #rm -rf fishbucket

Restart your splunk instance ($SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart)

Now, as soon as your files are updated on the application server, the whole contents of your files will be re-indexed into splunk in their corresponding indexes.
